# BAs Data
This folder contains the raw data present in "Optical properties of cubic boron arsenide" (Appl. Phys. Lett. 116, 141903 (2020); https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0004666). Each subfolder contains its own readme file with further details about its contents. 

- The excitonic subfolder corresponds to the optical data including excitonic effects presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4.
- The non-excitonic subfolder corresponds to the optical data without excitonic effects but with phonon-assisted processes presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4.
