# BAs Data
This folder contains the raw data present in "Band structure and carrier effective masses of boron arsenide: Effects of quasiparticle and spin-orbit coupling corrections" (Appl. Phys. Lett. 114, 022101 (2019); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5062845). Each subfolder contains its own readme file with further details about its contents. 

- The bands subfolder corresponds to the band structure data presented in Figure 1 and Tables 1-3.
- The effective_mass subfolder corresponds to the effective mass data and calculations, shown in Table 3 of the paper. 
- The dielectric_constant subfolder corresponds to the data presented in Figure 2 and Table 3.
