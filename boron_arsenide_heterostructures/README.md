# BAs Data
This folder contains the raw data present in "Boron arsenide heterostructures: lattice-matched heterointerfaces and strain effects on band alignments and mobility" (npj  Comput. Mater. 6, 3 (2020); https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-019-0270-4). Each subfolder contains its own readme file with further details about its contents. 

- The bands subfolder corresponds to the band structure data presented in Figure 2 and 3.
- The isosurface subfolder contains the raw data used to generate the isosurfaces presented in Figure 3.
- The mobility subfolder contains the mobility data from this work, presented in Figure 4. 
- The pseudos folder contains the pseudopotentials used for the calculations
