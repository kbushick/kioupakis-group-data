# Si Wannierization
This subfolder contains the data used to compute the wannierization of the Si band structure using the wannier90 code. This is applied to both the LDA and GW eignenvalues.   

- The inputs and outputs (scf, nscf, pw2wannier) for the quantum espresso runs are used to generate the nnkp, amn, mmn, and u\_matrix files that are used by wannier90 for the interpolation step. These same inputs to wannier90 are used for both the GW and LDA interpolation 
- The Si.win file contains the wannier90 input parameters used for the wannierization. 
- The dft\_output and gw\_output subfolders contain the outputs from the wannier90 runs, as well as the eigenvalue input file for the respective eigenvalues. For LDA, this file is generated by pw2wannier, for GW, this file is generated by sig2wan.
